to do:

0.1 increments for setting temperatures
reading switches for a specific day
removing single switches (probably by just setting it to OFF state)
remove all switches (by setting them all to OFF state)
adding switches (by taking one that is set to OFF and changing that)
permanently override temperature functionality (week program state OFF / ON)


once that is done:

copy Monday activity & code to all other days and modify appropriately
add Back buttons if we want this?
make it look pretty
rename the app


already done:

create all activities & connect them
read current & target temperature from server in real time
change target temperature
change day & night temperature functionality
