to do:

check if there is a server indication for heating and cooling down. Then we should use this to display the flame icon and some cooling down icon
show "loading" message for the 1 second it's loading the switches in a day activity (ONLY on start up NOT on resume when you go back from DayNight, switches are already loaded then)
no internet warning
tap and hold incr decr button to increase decrease by whole numbers
implement undo buttons
add back buttons if we want this? (Are there Android phones without a standard back button?)
