to do:

(M started) transferring interface from other branch to master.
Vacation Mode: add "(Week Program Enabled)"/"(Week Program Disabled)" to Week Overview button / add "Disables Week Program" explanation to Vacation Mode checkbox.
Adding switches: fix that a newly added switch cannot overlap with another switch.
Updating switches: make sure displaySwitches() works correctly after adding/removing a switch, it doesn't work for some reason. (This should fix randomly appearing bin icons too.)
Removing switches: fix this, it does not always work correctly, don't know why.
